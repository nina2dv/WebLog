# Useful Verilog Code Snippets

# Getting Started with Verilog
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It allows you to describe and simulate the behavior of digital circuits before implementing them in hardware. This beginner's guide will introduce you to the basics of Verilog.

## What is Verilog?
- Verilog is a HDL based on the C programming language
- It is used to describe and simulate the behavior and structure of digital circuits
- Verilog code can be synthesized into hardware using synthesis tools
- It allows hardware designers to verify designs before implementation

## Verilog Design Flow
The typical Verilog design flow involves:

1. Writing Verilog code to describe the behavior of a digital circuit
2. Simulating the code to verify functionality
3. Synthesizing the code to generate a netlist (connectivity of hardware components)
Implementing the design in hardware


##  Basic Verilog Syntax
Verilog has two core components - modules and ports.

### Modules
A module encapsulates a piece of design functionality. It consists of the interface ports and the internal logic. Here is a simple module example:

<Code language="verilog">
module AND_gate (
    input A, 
    input B,
    output Y
);

assign Y = A & B;

endmodule
</Code>

This module named AND_gate has 2 inputs, A and B, and 1 output Y. The internal logic performs the AND operation on the inputs to generate the output.

### Ports
Ports provide the interface to connect a module to other modules. There are 3 types of ports:

1. input - To bring data into the module
2. output - To send data out of the module
3. inout - Bidirectional flow of data

## Simulation
Verilog code can be simulated to verify functionality before synthesis and implementation. This is done using testbenches.

This was a simple introduction to Verilog. There are many additional concepts to learn including data types, operators, assignments, Always blocks and much more!
